# EscapeTheMaze

This is a simple maze generator with graphical UI written in C++ with the SFML graphics library.
There are three types of mazes which you can select from, then the app will randomly generate a maze (with DFS algorithm). Users control a character that starts at the beginning of the maze, and if they manage to finish it, a congratulations message will appear. The program facilitates maze solving by pressing spacebar (Dijkstra's algorithm), and you can zoom in/out to see the whole maze. The camera also follows the player, like a 2D Game.

The create/solve maze algorithms can be found in GameScreen.cpp
